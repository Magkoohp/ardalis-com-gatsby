If you're interested in building distributed, scalable, and robust applications in C#, you may have heard of MassTransit. This open-source messaging framework simplifies working with message brokers like RabbitMQ and Azure Service Bus, allowing you to focus more on business logic and less on infrastructure concerns.

## What Is MassTransit?

MassTransit is a free, open-source distributed application framework for .NET. It's a service bus for sending messages between different parts of your application, or even across different applications. With MassTransit, you can implement various messaging patterns such as publish/subscribe, request/response, and more, using a consistent and easy-to-understand API.

## Why Use MassTransit?

1. **Simplicity**: The framework abstracts away much of the boilerplate code required when dealing with message brokers directly.
2. **Extensibility**: Easily extend MassTransit by adding middleware components or integrating it with dependency injection frameworks.
3. **Asynchronous Messaging**: Embrace async programming with MassTransitâ€™s native support for asynchronous messaging.

It can also let you work with low level messaging tools like RabbitMQ with a LOT less code, as you'll see in a moment.

## Getting Started with MassTransit in C#

To kick things off, let's install the MassTransit NuGet package. We'll use the RabbitMQ version for this example.

```csharp
Install-Package MassTransit.RabbitMQ
```

### Basic Setup

Here's a basic example demonstrating how to set up a MassTransit service bus and a consumer, using RabbitMQ for the transport layer.

```csharp
using MassTransit;
using System;

namespace MassTransitExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var busControl = Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(cfg =>
            {
                var host = cfg.Host(new Uri("rabbitmq://localhost"), h => { });
                
                cfg.ReceiveEndpoint("my_queue", e =>
                {
                    e.Consumer<MyConsumer>();
                });
            });

            busControl.Start();
            
            Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit");
            Console.ReadKey();

            busControl.Stop();
        }
    }

    public class MyConsumer : IConsumer<MyMessage>
    {
        public async Task Consume(ConsumeContext<MyMessage> context)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Received: {context.Message.Text}");
        }
    }

    public class MyMessage
    {
        public string Text { get; set; }
    }
}
```

### Sending Messages

Sending messages is just as easy. The following example shows how to publish a message to the queue.

```csharp
var sendToUri = new Uri("rabbitmq://localhost/my_queue");
var endpoint = await busControl.GetSendEndpoint(sendToUri);
await endpoint.Send(new MyMessage { Text = "Hello, world!" });
```

This code can be added to the above code block right after `busControl.Start();`

The above examples rely on RabbitMQ. Here's how to easily get that set up.

# Running RabbitMQ Using Docker

Before you can dive into MassTransit, you'll need a message broker. RabbitMQ is one of the most popular choices, and fortunately, it's easy to set up using Docker. So let's go ahead and run RabbitMQ.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine

## Run RabbitMQ

You can pull and run the RabbitMQ Docker image using the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --hostname my-rabbit --name rabbitmq-server -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3-management
```

This command will:

- Run RabbitMQ as a daemon (`-d`)
- Set the hostname to `my-rabbit`
- Name the Docker container `rabbitmq-server`
- Map port 5672 for RabbitMQ and 15672 for the management interface

Once the container is running, you can access the RabbitMQ management interface at [http://localhost:15672/](http://localhost:15672/). The default username and password are `guest` and `guest`, respectively.

## Stop RabbitMQ

When you're done, you can stop the RabbitMQ container with the following command:

```bash
docker stop rabbitmq-server
```

And if you want to remove the container:

```bash
docker rm rabbitmq-server
```

## Output

Putting it all together, if you run the sample while RabbitMQ is running you should get output like this:

```powershell
PS> dotnet run
Hello, World!
Press any key to exit
Received: Hello, world!
```

## Conclusion

In a world full of complexities, MassTransit provides a simplified approach to messaging in C#. This article only scratches the surface of its capabilities - a hello world intro if you will - but there's certainly a lot to like about MassTransit. Follow some of the links below to learn more.
